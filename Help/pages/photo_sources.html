<h2>Photo sources</h2>
<content>
			<p>
				After opening a tracklog, choose a source of photos to geotag using the "Choose photo source..." pull-down button below the map. 
				</p>
			
			<p>
				Geotagalog can geotag photos directly from an attached camera or card reader. Make sure your device is connected, then pick it in the "Choose photo-source..." pull-down menu.
				Using this workflow is the easiest way to GPS-enable your camera.
				</p>
			
			<p>
				Geotagalog can also use individual photos from disk. Click "Choose photo source..." and then pick "Choose files or folders..." in the pull-down menu.
				Geotagalog will load all supported photos you choose, and will search folders and subfolders as well.
				You may also drag photo files and folders directly to Geotagalog's map or Dock icon.
