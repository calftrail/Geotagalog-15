<h2>Camera error</h2>
<content>
			<p>
				Since most tracklog devices have automatically set clocks, Geotagalog assumes that the timestamps in your tracklog are very accurate.
				However, your camera's clock may have been set slightly slow or fast. You may adjust this by pressing the "Change clock error" button (if necessary)
				to display the "Camera clock error" configuration. Move the slider to set what clock error your camera had.
				</p>
				
			<p>
				Geotagalog displays waypoint markers with X symbols on the map. This may be useful when lining up photos taken at known locations.
				Use the <a href="photo_preview.html">mouseover photo preview</a> to pick the correct photo thumbnail and adjust along the track until
				it is lined up with the matching waypoint marker.
