<h2>About tracklogs</h2>
<content>
			<p>
				A tracklog is a record of where you have gone. Tracklogs are often gathered by a GPS device or a phone that collects many sample locations in memory as you travel about.
				These sample locations are like pins in a map: the more pins you place, the better they could show the actual route you took.
				</p>
			
			<p>
				For automatic geotagging to work, each sample location should have a timestamp so that Geotagalog can guess where you were when you took each picture.
				If a photo was taken at a time between two location samples, Geotagalog will place the photo at a predicted location using a sophisticated
				interpolation algorithm. (Interpolation is like using a string to fill the gap between pins in a map.)
