<h2>iPhoto import</h2>
<content>
			<p>
				When your photos look reasonably positioned, press the "Import" button to load them into your current iPhoto library.
				Geotagalog does not modify your original photo files, so iPhoto will always import copies into its library, rather than referencing the original files.
				</p>
			
			<p>
				When photos are not geolocated well with the provided track data, Geotagalog will enable the "Don't geotag when unsure of location" checkbox.
				Use this checkbox to decide whether these photos will be geotagged with the potential poor locations.
				</p>
			
			<p>
				If you decide to not geotag photos with unsure locations, or if your photo source includes non-photo files (such as videos and audio clips),
				Geotagalog can also optionally these into iPhoto, although they will not be geotagged.
				Select the "Include ungeotagged items in import" checkbox to copy non-photo files into your current iPhoto library as part of the import process.
				</p>
			
			<p>
				If you are using an unregistered (demo) version, Geotagalog will only import into iPhoto a limited number of the photos and items.
				To remove this limitation, please <a href="http://calftrail.com/store">purchase a license key</a>.
