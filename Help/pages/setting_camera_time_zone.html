<h2>Camera time zone setting</h2>
<content>
			<p>
				To set the time zone, use the "Change time zone" button (if necessary) to display the "Camera time zone" configuration.
				If your camera is set to the same time zone as your computer, select the "Same as computer" option.
				</p>
			
			<p>
				If your camera was set to a different time zone, you will need to manually select how many hours the photos' timestamps are offset from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
				You may find information about time zone offsets on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone">this page</a>.
				</p>
			
			<p>
				(Note: At this time, Geotagalog does not support time zones with non-hour offsets. If your camera's time zone includes a half-hour or quarter-hour offset,
				consider setting your computer to the same time zone, or your camera to a different time zone.
				Otherwise, you must use the fine error correction to add or subtract this non-hour part of the time zone offset.)
