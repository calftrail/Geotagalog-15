<h2>Using tracklogs</h2>
<content>
			<p>
				To use Geotagalog, you first need to open a <a href="about_tracklogs.html">tracklog</a> by clicking the "Open tracklog..." button in the welcome screen.
				Once you have successfully opened a tracklog, Geotagalog will display it on a map so you can use it to geotag photos from a source.
				</p>
			
			<p>
				You may add multiple tracklog files to the map. Simply select multiple tracklogs when opening, use the "File &gt; Open" menu to select another tracklog file,
				or drag tracklog files to Geotagalog's map or Dock icon.
				When prompted, select the "Add Tracks" option. The type of tracklog file does not matter: you can use a GPX file and an NMEA log file on the same map.
				</p>
			
			<p>
				Geotagalog supports tracklogs in several popular formats: the standard GPX format, NMEA 0183 logs, Garmin Training Center (.tcx) files, and FAI Gliding Commission (.igc) flight recordings.
				If your tracking device does not let you directly access tracklogs in one of these formats, you may need to use other software to download and/or convert your tracklogs to a supported format.
